### Indirect Questions
 An indirect question is any sentence or clause which is introduced by an interrogative word (pronoun, adverb, etc.), and which is itself the subject or object of a verb, or depends on any expression implying uncertainty or doubt.

 An indirect question takes its verb in the subjunctive.
 ```
Quid ipse sentiam expōnam.
I will explain what I think.
 ```
